      <description>Aesthetic Perception and Cognition Date: October 20–21, 2022
Venue: Uppsala University
Organisers: Elisabeth Schellekens, Maarten Steenhagen
Submission deadline: 10th of July 2022 (Extended)
Conference description: The purpose of this conference is to reconsider one of the cornerstones of philosophical aesthetics: the idea that aesthetics is fundamentally about a form of perception. This assumption has crucial implications for our understanding both of the nature of aesthetic value and of how we form beliefs about such value.</description>

      <title>Foundations of the perceptual model</title>

      <description>Where does the idea that aesthetic judgment is about perception or sensation come from? What is the motivation for excluding cognitive or intellectual forms of engagement from the aesthetic? Are there authors who subvert this close tie between aesthetics and the senses? In this reading group we read a variety of authors who have acknowledged intelligible forms of beauty.
Central texts:
Plotinus, &amp;lsquo;On Beauty&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;On Intellectual Beauty&amp;rsquo; Baumgarten, Aesthetica (fragments) Meeting time: Tuesdays 12:30-14:00 (fortnightly)</description>

      <title>Intellectual Beauty in Medieval Aesthetics</title>
      <link>https://aestheticperceptioncognition.se/events/reading-group-medievals/</link>

      <description>Can analytic aestheticians in the 21st century talk about intelligible beauty still? Is the idea of intelligible beauty a secular one, at least in principle? And how do we experience or grasp the intelligible? We study fragments and essays of three central medieval authors: Augustine, Acquinas, and Plotinus. On the basis of these readings, it is clear that there is a pre-modern tradition of conceiving of aesthetic value as possibly or even primarily intellectual or spiritual.</description>

      <title>The Aesthetic Life</title>
      <link>https://aestheticperceptioncognition.se/events/reading-group-autumn/</link>

      <description>Think of the aesthetic value realised in good character, in good urban planning, in one’s personal style, of the ugliness of consumerism, etc. What is the place of such values in our lives? And what is the place of those values in a theory of aesthetic experience or judgment?
Discussing the place of aesthetic value in our lives, broadly construed, is likely to help us to be more critical of the idea that aesthetic experience is at root sensory or perceptual, considering life is about so much more.</description>

      <description>From June to August 2020, the Aesthetic Perception and Cognition project at Uppsala University will organise a series of online discussion seminars on central topics in philosophical aesthetics.
For these seminars, we have invited a group of wonderful people to contribute short essays, which will set a starting point for reflection and friendly debate. We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to present our full schedule below.
The plan is simple. We will meet on Zoom weekly, from mid-June until early August.</description>

      <title>Reading group Aesthetic Practices</title>
      <link>https://aestheticperceptioncognition.se/events/reading-group/</link>

      <description>People’s engagement with art is highly conventionalised and habitual. Within specific cultures and time periods we can look for aesthetic practices in order to understand better the expectations people have of art, and the values they associate with it. We can take such practices to codify dominant assumptions about what art is and about how we ought to treat it. In particular, a careful analysis of aesthetic practice can help us answer the question: What are the assumptions about the role of perception and cognition in our engagement with art that underpin the way people in fact engage with art?</description>

      <title>Aesthetics, Character, and Conduct</title>
      <link>https://aestheticperceptioncognition.se/events/reading-group-spring/</link>

      <description>Standardly we think of aesthetic value as something attached to things we can see, hear, or taste. But what about the value realised in good character, or in an apt moral outlook? Can such values ever be aesthetic? Can aesthetic judgment be relevant for the proper assessment of human character and conduct? We will discuss these and more specific questions in light of two historical authors: Hume and Schiller.
Meeting time: Tuesday 12:30-14:00 (fortnightly)</description>
