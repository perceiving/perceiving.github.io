      <description>Viral dreamcatcher keytar typewriter, aesthetic offal umami. Wellness spaces that reach neglected communities of color are essential, says spiritual advisor, mojo health advocate, and writer Anna Smith. As the 26-year-old Brooklyn native will tell you in her signature metaphysical-no-chaser way, when your mojo is in a bad place every aspect of your life is affected. She’s part of a growing effort to foster more inclusive healing spaces that take into account how racism, poverty, ableism, misogyny, and gender discrimination inform our self-care needs.</description>

      <description>Chatting with the ancestors I always say my thanks to my ancestors and talk with them, with my guides. I talk to them about my day, what I want, what they need of me. I give my thanks to them for the day, even if I had a bad day. I let them know, ‘Thank you for making sure I ain’t die today, I survived through the fuck shit.It’s a big comfort to me to have that open line of communication because so many of my spirit guides are people who I knew in this lifetime who passed on, one being my father, one being my abuelita.</description>
