      <description>Aesthetic Practices 28-29 May 2020, Uppsala University (Deadline: 1 March 2020)
Organizers: Elisabeth Schellekens (Uppsala University), Maarten Steenhagen (Uppsala University)
Workshop Peopleâ€™s engagement with art is highly conventionalised and habitual. Within specific cultures and time periods we can look for aesthetic practices in order to understand better the expectations people have of art, and the values they associate with it. We can take such practices to codify dominant assumptions about what art is and about how we ought to treat it.</description>

      <description>Introduction The cornerstone of philosophical aesthetics, conceived as an area of philosophy primarily concerned with aesthetic and artistic experience, has long been its connection with perception. Ever since the formal inception of the discipline in the mid-eighteenth century, aesthetics (from the Greek aesthesis) has taken that which pertains to the senses, or sense perception, as its subject-matter (Baumgarten 1750; Kant 1790). More particularly, the study of aesthetics has typically concerned itself with the perceptual experience of aesthetic value.</description>
