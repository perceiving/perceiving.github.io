      <title>The interactive character of installation art</title>

      <description>Works of installation art are structured around the beholders, who are invited to explore their spaces and the objects possibly placed within those (see e.g. Reiss 1999; Rebentisch 2003; Bishop 2005; Ring Petersen 2015).
Think of Robert Irwin&#39;s Untitled (1971). The work is displayed by hanging a rectangular, transparent cloth from the ceiling of an empty gallery room and anchoring it to the floor, to keep it stretched and wrinkleless. The cloth hangs obliquely – its lower rim is closer to the back wall of the room than its upper rim – and is as wide as the back wall: the beholders cannot reach the back wall, but they can get close to the cloth, which creates a space with a very sloping roof.</description>

      <title>Metaphor and conceptual art</title>

      <description>Non-linguistic artworks such as painting, installation, sculpture, etc., often use metaphor to somehow convey their meaning, and their cognitive and artistic effects. Consider Banksy’s small mural in Essex, consisting of five pigeons holding up signs reading ‘go back to Africa’, ‘migrants not welcome’, and ‘keep off our worms’ towards a colourful swallow. The work has been interpreted as a satirical metaphor, potently mocking the rise of anti-immigration sentiment in Britain today (Sinclair &amp;amp; Pringle, 2017: 32) (while the piece does use words, the metaphor itself isn’t linguistic).</description>

      <title>The Borders of Perception</title>

      <description>What can we perceive, in a metaphysical sense of the question – what legitimately is a target of a perceptual state? For a long while, in philosophy this venerable debate has concerned the issue of what the objects of perception are, sensory objects as they have been recently labeled (Nanay 2013). Yet there is no agreement at all among philosophers on which are such objects – for some intuitionists, even abstract objects can be perceived, while for some others, the so-called indirect realists, the only objects that are properly perceived are sense-data, mind-dependent entities.</description>

      <title>Aesthetics of action, arts of action</title>
      <link>https://aestheticperceptioncognition.se/ideas/aesthetics-of-action/</link>

      <description>High art culture has tended to focus on the arts of objects and largely ignored the arts of action. These are the arts designed to call forth activity from their audience, for the sake of that audience’s appreciation of their own activity. I mean things like: rock climbing, games, improvised communal dance, and social food rituals. These arts are either marginalized by high art culture, or they are awkwardly squeezed to fit into the paradigm of the object arts.</description>

      <title>A Cornerstone of Philosophical Aesthetics?</title>
      <link>https://aestheticperceptioncognition.se/ideas/a-cornerstone/</link>

      <description>Introduction The cornerstone of philosophical aesthetics, conceived as an area of philosophy primarily concerned with aesthetic and artistic experience, has long been its connection with perception. Ever since the formal inception of the discipline in the mid-eighteenth century, aesthetics (from the Greek aesthesis) has taken that which pertains to the senses, or sense perception, as its subject-matter (Baumgarten 1750; Kant 1790). More particularly, the study of aesthetics has typically concerned itself with the perceptual experience of aesthetic value.</description>
